# Simulation-2020
All my codes from 2020 Simulation's Classes at UTN

Firsts _simulations_, from TP1.1 to TP3.0, were developed in **Python**. Since TP3.0 **AnyLogic** is used. All _documents_ are made with **LaTeX**

## [TP1.1] - Roulette Analysis
Statistical analysis of a European roulette made through a simulation

## [TP1.2] - Strategies Roulette Simulation
Different strategies for playing roulette will be used (simulated) in order to analyze the benefits and / or disadvantages of them

## [TP2.1] - Pseudorandom Generators
Study of pseudo-random numbers generators, then performing generation quality tests on them

## [TP2.2] - Pseudorandoms with Different Distributions
Study of pseudo-random numbers with different distribution's generator algorithms, then performing some tests on them

## [TP3.0] - Single-server Queuing System
M/M/1 Queue Model: Simulation and Analysis of common performance measures (Comparison: Python, AnyLogic, Analytic Model Results)

## [AnyLogic Tutorials]
Express tutorials made to learn the basics of anylogic and thus be able to perform a better final TP

## [TPI] - Docking Services Simulation (Final TP)
Real simulation of the critical processes of the organization "Servicios Portuarios SA" located in Argentina. From the arrival and unloading of the trucks, through the storage and conditioning services that are performed on the cereals, until finally the shipment.
