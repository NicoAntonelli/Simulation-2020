# Simulation-2020
All my codes from 2020 Simulation's Classes at UTN

Firsts _simulations_ were developed in **Python**, but **AnyLogic** will be used in the future. All _documents_ are made with **LaTeX**

## [TP1.1] - Roulette Analysis
Statistical analysis of a European roulette made through a simulation

## [TP1.2] - Strategies Roulette Simulation
Different strategies for playing roulette will be used (simulated) in order to analyze the benefits and / or disadvantages of them

## [TP2.1] - Pseudorandom Generators
Study of pseudo-random numbers generators, then performing generation quality tests on them

## [TP2.2] - Pseudorandoms with Different Distributions
Study of pseudo-random numbers with different distribution's generator algorithms, then performing some tests on them
