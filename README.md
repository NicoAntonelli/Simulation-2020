# Simulation-2020
All my codes from 2020 Simulation's Classes at UTN

Firsts _simulations_, from TP1.1 to TP3.0, were developed in **Python**. Since TP3.0 **AnyLogic** is used. All _documents_ are made with **LaTeX**

## [TP1.1] - Roulette Analysis
Statistical analysis of a European roulette made through a simulation

## [TP1.2] - Strategies Roulette Simulation
Different strategies for playing roulette will be used (simulated) in order to analyze the benefits and / or disadvantages of them

## [TP2.1] - Pseudorandom Generators
Study of pseudo-random numbers generators, then performing generation quality tests on them

## [TP2.2] - Pseudorandoms with Different Distributions
Study of pseudo-random numbers with different distribution's generator algorithms, then performing some tests on them

## [TP3.0] - Single-server Queuing System
M/M/1 Queue Model: Simulation and Analysis of common performance measures (Comparison: Python, AnyLogic, Analytic Model Results)
