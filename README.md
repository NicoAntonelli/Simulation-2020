# Simulation-2020
All my codes from 2020 Simulation's Classes at UTN

Firsts _simulations_, from TP1.1 to TP3.0, were developed in **Python**. Since TP3.0 **AnyLogic** is used. All _documents_ are made with **LaTeX**

## [TP1.1] - Roulette Analysis
Statistical analysis of a European roulette made through a simulation

## [TP1.2] - Strategies Roulette Simulation
Different strategies for playing roulette will be used (simulated) in order to analyze the benefits and / or disadvantages of them

## [TP2.1] - Pseudorandom Generators
Study of pseudo-random numbers generators, then performing generation quality tests on them

## [TP2.2] - Pseudorandoms with Different Distributions
Study of pseudo-random numbers with different distribution's generator algorithms, then performing some tests on them

## [TP3.0] - Single-server Queuing System
M/M/1 Queue Model: Simulation and Analysis of common performance measures (Comparison: Python, AnyLogic, Analytic Model Results)

## [AnyLogic Tutorials]
Express tutorials made to learn the basics of anylogic and thus be able to perform a better final TP

## [TPI] - Docking Services (Servicios Portuarios) Simulation - Final TP

### Trucks' arrival to the port, storage and shipment of grains

This work proposes a dynamic computational simulation to study the behavior
and performance of the activities that make up the critical grain shipment process
from one of Rosario’s ports (city considered to be the most important agro-export
node in the world), through the implementation of measurable indicators for the
different activities in the simulated process to then analyze, through an alternative
model, how a specific change (such as increasing the silos’ unload rate by purchasing
better conveyor belts) can decrease the shipping time of grains and how this change
influences other activities in the process, eliminating bottlenecks and making the
port a more desirable option compared to the competition, justifying whether the
investment necessary to optimize such activities is worth it.
